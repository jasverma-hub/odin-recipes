# Odin Recipes

This is the first HTML project I created after enrolling in the Odin Foundation course. It's a very basic recipe website made using only HTML, and serves as my starting point for learning web development.

Of course, Iâ€™ll be building more complex and feature-rich projects as I continue through the course!
